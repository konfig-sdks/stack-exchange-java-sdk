Gets the comments on a set of answers.   If you know that you have an answer id and need the comments, use this method. If you know you have a question id, use /questions/{id}/comments. If you are unsure, use /posts/{id}/comments.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for answer_id on answer objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   creation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of comments.

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

    StackExchange client = new StackExchange(configuration);
    String ids = "ids_example"; // Number list (semicolon delimited).
    String site = "site_example"; // Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \"stackoverflow.com\"), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object. 
    String order = "desc";
    String max = "max_example"; // sort = creation => date sort = votes => number 
    String min = "min_example"; // sort = creation => date sort = votes => number 
    String sort = "creation";
    Integer fromdate = 56; // Unix date.
    Integer todate = 56; // Unix date.
    Integer pagesize = 56;
    Integer page = 56;
    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

Gets the set of answers identified by ids.   This is meant for batch fetcing of questions. A useful trick to poll for updates is to sort by activity, with a minimum date of the last time you polled.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for answer_id on answer objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of answers.

    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

Gets the answers to a set of questions identified in id.   This method is most useful if you have a set of interesting questions, and you wish to obtain all of their answers at once or if you are polling for new or updates answers (in conjunction with sort&#x3D;activity).   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id on question objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.

Returns questions the site considers to be unanswered.   Note that just because a question has an answer, that does not mean it is considered answered. While the rules are subject to change, at this time a question must have at least one upvoted answer to be considered answered.   To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged&#x3D;c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.   Compare with /questions/no-answers.   This method corresponds roughly with the unanswered tab.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

public class Example {

    Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
    configuration.host = "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.0";
    StackExchange client = new StackExchange(configuration);
    String site = "site_example"; // Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \"stackoverflow.com\"), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object. 
    String tagged = "tagged_example"; // String list (semicolon delimited).
    String order = "desc";
    String max = "max_example"; // sort = activity => date sort = creation => date sort = votes => number 
    String min = "min_example"; // sort = activity => date sort = creation => date sort = votes => number 
    String sort = "activity";
    Integer fromdate = 56; // Unix date.
    Integer todate = 56; // Unix date.
    Integer pagesize = 56;
    Integer page = 56;
    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

Returns questions which have received no answers.   Compare with /questions/unanswered which mearly returns questions that the sites consider insufficiently well answered.   This method corresponds roughly with the this site tab.   To constrain questions returned to those with a set of tags, use the tagged parameter with a semi-colon delimited list of tags. This is an and contraint, passing tagged&#x3D;c;java will return only those questions with both tags. As such, passing more than 5 tags will always return zero results.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **tag** | **String**|  | |
| **period** | **String**|  | [enum: all_time, month] |
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold.
