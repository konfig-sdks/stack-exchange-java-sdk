public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Configuration configuration = new Configuration();
    configuration.host = "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.0";
    StackExchange client = new StackExchange(configuration);
    String ids = "ids_example"; // Number list (semicolon delimited).
    Integer pagesize = 56;
    Integer page = 56;
    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

Get the comments posted by users in {ids}.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   creation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of comments.

Get the questions that users in {ids} have favorited.   This method is effectively a view onto a user&#39;s favorites tab.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score  - added - when the user favorited the question   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

# **getInboxItems**
> List&lt;InboxItemsInner&gt; getInboxItems(id, site).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns a user&#39;s inbox.   This method requires an access_token, with a scope containing \&quot;read_inbox\&quot;.   This method is effectively an alias for /inbox. It is provided for consumers who make strong assumptions about operating within the context of a single site rather than the Stack Exchange network as a whole.   {id} can contain a single id, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   This method returns a list of inbox items.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | **Integer**|  | |
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \&quot;safe\&quot; filter is mearly an \&quot;unsafe\&quot; one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \&quot;safe\&quot; data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \&quot;unsafe\&quot; filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | OK |  -  |
| **400** | bad_parameter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 400 An invalid parameter was passed, this includes even \&quot;high level\&quot; parameters like key or site.  |  -  |
| **401** | access_token_required Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 401 A method that requires an access token (obtained via authentication) was called without one.  |  -  |
| **402** | invalid_access_token Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 402 An invalid access token was passed to a method.  |  -  |
| **403** | access_denied Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 403 A method which requires certain permissions was called with an access token that lacks those permissions.  |  -  |
| **404** | no_method Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 404 An attempt was made to call a method that does not exist. Note, calling methods that expect numeric ids (like /users/{ids}) with non-numeric ids can also result in this error.  |  -  |
| **405** | key_required Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 405 A method was called in a manner that requires an application key (generally, with an access token), but no key was passed.  |  -  |
| **406** | access_token_compromised Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 406 An access token is no longer believed to be secure, normally because it was used on a non-HTTPS call. The access token will be invalidated if this error is returned.  |  -  |
| **500** | internal_error Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 500 An unexpected error occurred in the API. It has been logged, and Stack Exchange developers have been notified. You should report these errors on Stack Apps if you want to be notified when they&#39;re fixed.  |  -  |
| **502** | throttle_violation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 502 An application has violated part of the rate limiting contract, so the request was terminated.  |  -  |
| **503** | temporarily_unavailable Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 503 Some or all of the API is unavailable. Applications should backoff on requests to the method invoked.  |  -  |

# **getPrivilegesList**
> List&lt;PrivilegesInner&gt; getPrivilegesList(id, site).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns the privileges a user has.   Applications are encouraged to calculate privileges themselves, without repeated queries to this method. A simple check against the results returned by /privileges and user.user_type would be sufficient.   {id} can contain only a single, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   This method returns a list of privileges.

Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids}.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

# **getReputationChanges**
> List&lt;ReputationChangesInner&gt; getReputationChanges(ids, site).fromdate(fromdate).todate(todate).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Gets a subset of the reputation changes for users in {ids}.   Reputation changes are intentionally scrubbed of some data to make it difficult to correlate votes on particular posts with user reputation changes. That being said, this method returns enough data for reasonable display of reputation trends.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   This method returns a list of reputation objects.

    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.

Returns the suggested edits a users in {ids} have submitted.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the suggested_edit object:  - creation - creation_date  - approval - approval_date Does not return unapproved suggested_edits  - rejection - rejection_date Does not return unrejected suggested_edits   creation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of suggested-edits.

Returns the tags the users identified in {ids} have been active in.   This route corresponds roughly to user&#39;s stats tab, but does not include tag scores.

The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the tag object:  - popular - count  - activity - the creation_date of the last question asked with the tag  - name - name   popular is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of tags.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Returns the top 30 questions a user has asked with the given tags.   {id} can contain a single id, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {tags} is limited to 5 tags, passing more will result in an error.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids} which have at least one answer, but no accepted answer.   Questions returned by this method have answers, but the owner has not opted to accept any of them.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids} which the site consideres unanswered, while still having at least one answer posted.   These rules are subject to change, but currently any question without at least one upvoted or accepted answer is considered unanswered.   To get the set of questions that a user probably considers unanswered, the returned questions should be unioned with those returned by /users/{id}/questions/no-answers. These methods are distinct so that truly unanswered (that is, zero posted answers) questions can be easily separated from mearly poorly or inadequately answered ones.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **order** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: desc, asc] |
| **max** | **String**| sort &#x3D; reputation &#x3D;&gt; number sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; name &#x3D;&gt; string sort &#x3D; modified &#x3D;&gt; date  | [optional] |
| **min** | **String**| sort &#x3D; reputation &#x3D;&gt; number sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; name &#x3D;&gt; string sort &#x3D; modified &#x3D;&gt; date  | [optional] |
| **sort** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: reputation, creation, name, modified] |
| **fromdate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **todate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \&quot;safe\&quot; filter is mearly an \&quot;unsafe\&quot; one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \&quot;safe\&quot; data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \&quot;unsafe\&quot; filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.  | [optional] |
| **paramCallback** | **String**| All API responses are JSON, we do support JSONP with the callback query parameter.  | [optional] |

### HTTP response details
| Status code | Description | Response headers |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **200** | OK |  -  |
| **400** | bad_parameter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 400 An invalid parameter was passed, this includes even \&quot;high level\&quot; parameters like key or site.  |  -  |
| **401** | access_token_required Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 401 A method that requires an access token (obtained via authentication) was called without one.  |  -  |
| **402** | invalid_access_token Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 402 An invalid access token was passed to a method.  |  -  |
| **403** | access_denied Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 403 A method which requires certain permissions was called with an access token that lacks those permissions.  |  -  |
| **404** | no_method Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 404 An attempt was made to call a method that does not exist. Note, calling methods that expect numeric ids (like /users/{ids}) with non-numeric ids can also result in this error.  |  -  |
| **405** | key_required Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 405 A method was called in a manner that requires an application key (generally, with an access token), but no key was passed.  |  -  |
| **406** | access_token_compromised Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 406 An access token is no longer believed to be secure, normally because it was used on a non-HTTPS call. The access token will be invalidated if this error is returned.  |  -  |

Returns the answers the users in {ids} have posted.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of answers.

Get the comments that the users in {ids} have posted in reply to the single user identified in {toid}.   This method is useful for extracting conversations, especially over time or across multiple posts.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {toid} can contain only 1 id, found in the same manner as those in {ids}.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   creation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of comments.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **ids** | **String**| Number list (semicolon delimited). | |
| **toid** | **Integer**|  | |
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **order** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: desc, asc] |
| **max** | **String**| sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; votes &#x3D;&gt; number  | [optional] |
| **min** | **String**| sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; votes &#x3D;&gt; number  | [optional] |
| **sort** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: creation, votes] |
| **fromdate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **todate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \&quot;safe\&quot; filter is mearly an \&quot;unsafe\&quot; one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \&quot;safe\&quot; data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \&quot;unsafe\&quot; filters.

> List&lt;UsersInner&gt; getUserProfilesByIds(ids, site).order(order).max(max).min(min).sort(sort).fromdate(fromdate).todate(todate).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Gets the users identified in ids in {ids}.   Typically this method will be called to fetch user profiles when you have obtained user ids from some other source, such as /questions.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:  - reputation - reputation  - creation - creation_date  - name - display_name  - modified - last_modified_date   reputation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of users.

# **getUserTimelineByIds**
> List&lt;UserTimelineObjectsInner&gt; getUserTimelineByIds(ids, site).fromdate(fromdate).todate(todate).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns a subset of the actions the users in {ids} have taken on the site.   This method returns users&#39; posts, edits, and earned badges in the order they were accomplished. It is possible to filter to just a window of activity using the fromdate and todate parameters.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   This method returns a list of user timeline objects.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **ids** | **String**| Number list (semicolon delimited). | |
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **fromdate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **todate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \&quot;safe\&quot; filter is mearly an \&quot;unsafe\&quot; one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \&quot;safe\&quot; data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \&quot;unsafe\&quot; filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form.

Returns the top 30 answers a user has posted in response to questions with the given tags.   {id} can contain a single id, to find it programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects. {tags} is limited to 5 tags, passing more will result in an error.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the answer object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of answers.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **id** | **Integer**|  | |
| **tags** | **String**| String list (semicolon delimited). | |
| **site** | **String**| Each of these methods operates on a single site at a time, identified by the site parameter. This parameter can be the full domain name (ie. \&quot;stackoverflow.com\&quot;), or a short form identified by api_site_parameter on the site object.  | |
| **order** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: desc, asc] |
| **max** | **String**| sort &#x3D; activity &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; votes &#x3D;&gt; number  | [optional] |
| **min** | **String**| sort &#x3D; activity &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; creation &#x3D;&gt; date sort &#x3D; votes &#x3D;&gt; number  | [optional] |
| **sort** | **String**|  | [optional] [enum: activity, creation, votes] |
| **fromdate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **todate** | **Integer**| Unix date. | [optional] |
| **pagesize** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **page** | **Integer**|  | [optional] |
| **filter** | **String**| #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user&#39;s badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \&quot;bake in\&quot; any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \&quot;safe\&quot; filter is mearly an \&quot;unsafe\&quot; one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \&quot;safe\&quot; data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \&quot;unsafe\&quot; filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0. New applications should not use these filters.  | [optional] |
| **paramCallback** | **String**| All API responses are JSON, we do support JSONP with the callback query parameter.  | [optional] |

# **getWritePermissions**
> List&lt;WritePermissionsInner&gt; getWritePermissions(id, site).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns the write permissions a user has via the api.   The Stack Exchange API gives users the ability to create, edit, and delete certain types. This method returns whether the passed user is capable of performing those actions at all, as well as how many times a day they can.   This method does not consider the user&#39;s current quota (ie. if they&#39;ve already exhausted it for today) nor any additional restrictions on write access, such as editing deleted comments.   This method returns a list of write_permissions.

<a name="listAccountMerges"></a>
# **listAccountMerges**
> List&lt;AccountMergeInner&gt; listAccountMerges(ids).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns a record of merges that have occurred involving the passed account ids.   This method allows you to take now invalid account ids and find what account they&#39;ve become, or take currently valid account ids and find which ids were equivalent in the past.   This is most useful when confirming that an account_id is in fact \&quot;new\&quot; to an application.   Account merges can happen for a wide range of reasons, applications should not make assumptions that merges have particular causes.   Note that accounts are managed at a network level, users on a site may be merged due to an account level merge but there is no guarantee that a merge has an effect on any particular site.   This method returns a list of account_merge.

> List&lt;UsersInner&gt; listElectedModeratorUsers(site).order(order).max(max).min(min).sort(sort).fromdate(fromdate).todate(todate).pagesize(pagesize).page(page).filter(filter).paramCallback(paramCallback).execute();



Returns those users on a site who both have moderator powers, and were actually elected.   This method excludes Stack Exchange Inc. employees, unless they were actually elected moderators on a site (which can only have happened prior to their employment).   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:  - reputation - reputation  - creation - creation_date  - name - display_name  - modified - last_modified_date   reputation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of users.

    String order = "desc";
    String max = "max_example"; // sort = reputation => number sort = creation => date sort = name => string sort = modified => date 
    String min = "min_example"; // sort = reputation => number sort = creation => date sort = name => string sort = modified => date

    String filter = "filter_example"; // #Discussion  The Stack Exchange API allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

Gets those users on a site who can exercise moderation powers.   Note, employees of Stack Exchange Inc. will be returned if they have been granted moderation powers on a site even if they have never been appointed or elected explicitly. This method checks abilities, not the manner in which they were obtained.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:  - reputation - reputation  - creation - creation_date  - name - display_name  - modified - last_modified_date   reputation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of users.

Gets the questions asked by the users in {ids} which have no answers.   Questions returns by this method actually have zero undeleted answers. It is completely disjoint /users/{ids}/questions/unanswered and /users/{ids}/questions/unaccepted, which only return questions with at least one answer, subject to other contraints.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the question object:  - activity - last_activity_date  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   activity is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of questions.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. These are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in V2.0.

Get the badges the users in {ids} have earned.   Badge sorts are a tad complicated. For the purposes of sorting (and min/max) tag_based is considered to be greater than named.   This means that you can get a list of all tag based badges a user has by passing min&#x3D;tag_based, and conversely all the named badges by passing max&#x3D;named, with sort&#x3D;type.   For ranks, bronze is greater than silver which is greater than gold. Along with sort&#x3D;rank, set max&#x3D;gold for just gold badges, max&#x3D;silver&amp;min&#x3D;silver for just silver, and min&#x3D;bronze for just bronze.   rank is the default sort.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   This method returns a list of badges.

Returns all users on a site.   This method returns a list of users.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the user object:  - reputation - reputation  - creation - creation_date  - name - display_name  - modified - last_modified_date   reputation is the default sort.    It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     The inname parameter lets consumers filter the results down to just those users with a certain substring in their display name. For example, inname&#x3D;kevin will return all users with both users named simply \&quot;Kevin\&quot; or those with Kevin as one of (or part of) their names; such as \&quot;Kevin Montrose\&quot;.

For example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users.  An application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter.  Filters are immutable and non-expiring. An application can safely \"bake in\" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime.  The motivation for filters are several fold. Filters allow applications to reduce API responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. With the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the API can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). Finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the API returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x API family).  #Safety  Filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. Any string returned as a result of an API call with a safe filter will be inline-able into HTML without script-injection concerns. That is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, HTML tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. Applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. All filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections.  Note that this does not mean that \"safe\" filter is mearly an \"unsafe\" one with all fields passed though UrlEncode(...). Many fields can and will contain HTML in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields).  When using unsafe filters, the API returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. This means that in cases where the \"safe\" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in \"unsafe\" filters. Notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. Fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation.  #Built In Filters  The following filters are built in:  default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total  #Compatibility with V1.x  For ease of transition from earlier API versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in.

Gets all the comments that the users in {ids} were mentioned in.   Note, to count as a mention the comment must be considered to be \&quot;in reply to\&quot; a user. Most importantly, this means that a comment can only be in reply to a single user.   {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.   The sorts accepted by this method operate on the follow fields of the comment object:  - creation - creation_date  - votes - score   It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.     This method returns a list of comments.
